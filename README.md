# ConvaysGameOfLife
A Java graphical interface for Convays Game of Life originally intended for teaching Java

## General Description

This project contains an implementation of convays game of life, a popular cellular automaton named after mathematician John Convay. It is written in Java and provides a graphical interface that renders an interactive gameboard to visualize the rules that govern the incremental progression of the population of cells.
The implementation is reasonably simple. The most complicated parts are the interface and the threading for game board updating. The actual rules that determine the survival or death of a cell are abstracted into the `ConvaysGameRule` class. More precisely the `nextGeneration` method takes in a 2d boolean array and computes the next generation of the population.
