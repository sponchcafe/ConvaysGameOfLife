# ConwaysGameOfLife A Java graphical interface for Conway's Game of Life

originally intended for teaching Java

This project contains an implementation of Conway's game of life, a popular
cellular automaton named after mathematician John Conway. It is written in Java
and provides a graphical interface that renders an interactive gameboard to
visualize the rules that govern the incremental progression of the population
of cells.
